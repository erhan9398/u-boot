About
-----

NXP's HSE provides Advanced Secure Boot (ASB), which uses
Secure Memory Regions (SMR) and a device-specific key.

The demo application in hse_adv_secboot.c is provided as a U-Boot command.
The demo application demonstrates secure booting from an SD card,
on the S32gen1 boards.

Prerequisites
-------------

HSE FW must be on the SD card to be able to use the demo applications.

HSE is a separate NXP product, available through Flexera. To find out
how to obtain HSE, please address our marketing department.

Building U-Boot with HSE secure boot support
--------------------------------------------

The follow config options must be set:

    CONFIG_S32_GEN1="y"
    CONFIG_HSE_SECBOOT="y" (depends on CONFIG_S32_GEN1)
    CONFIG_CMD_HSE_ADVANCED_SECBOOT="y" (depends on CONFIG_HSE_SECBOOT)

Furthermore, the CONFIG_SYS_TEXT_BASE option must be set to 0x34080000.

Preparing U-Boot for secure booting
-----------------------------------

The script "tools/s32gen1_secboot.sh" is provided to easily configure
and sign U-Boot for secure booting.

Please note that, for the moment, the script uses a fixed key pair,
stored in clear in the script. Support for user-generated RSA key
pairs will be added in BSP26.

The following steps are taken by the script to configure, sign and
write the signed U-Boot image to the SD card:

    1. Generate a RSA2048 key pair;
    2. Extract application code and application header from u-boot.s32;
    3. Pad extracted image to 1M;
    4. Sign the extracted image with the generated private key;
    5. Verify the signed image with the generated public key;
    6. Write IVT to SD card;
    7. Write HSE FW to SD card;
    8. Write signature to SD card;
    9. Write DCD to SD card;
    10. Write signed and padded image to SD card.

The following SD card layout is used for secure boot:

-------------  0x0
|    IVT    |
-------------  0x100
|    MBR    |
-------------  0x200
|  HSE FW   |
-------------  0x70200
|  SYS_IMG  |
-------------  0x80200
| SIGNATURE |
-------------  0x80400
|   U-Boot  |
-------------  0x180400

Booting in secure boot
----------------------

To activate secure boot, we first need to generate a SYS-IMG file for HSE, which
will be signed with a device-specific key. Fortunately, this is handled by HSE
itself, and is taken care of by the ASB demo application. Boot the board, and
run the following in the U-Boot command line:

	hse_adv_secboot_prep_demo

After the command has run, you can reboot the board and it will boot securely. You
can check by verifying the secure boot bit in the IVT:

00000020: 0024 0800 0000 0000 0900 0000 0000 0000

Turning off secure boot
-----------------------

To stop booting securely, the IVT must be rewritten and the SYS-IMG on the SD card
must be deleted. The secure boot SD layout need not be kept, so this can easily be
done by overwriting the data on the SD card, though it is suggested to zero out the
area needed before hand.

	dd if=u-boot/u-boot.s32 of=/dev/sdb bs=512 conv=notrunc,fsync
