About
-----

NXP's HSE provides Advanced Secure Boot (ASB), which uses
Secure Memory Regions (SMR) and a device-specific key.

The demo application in hse_adv_secboot.c is provided as a U-Boot command.
The demo application demonstrates secure booting from an SD card,
on the S32gen1 boards.

Prerequisites
-------------

HSE FW must be on the SD card to be able to use the demo applications.

HSE is a separate NXP product, available through Flexera. To find out
how to obtain HSE, please address our marketing department.

Building U-Boot with HSE secure boot support
--------------------------------------------

If the CONFIG_S32_GEN1 option is set to 'y' in the .config file, the
CONFIG_HSE_SECBOOT option must be enabled, as well as the
CONFIG_CMD_HSE_ADVANCED_SECBOOT option, to enable the secboot prepare
command in the u-boot command line.

Furthermore, the CONFIG_SYS_TEXT_BASE option must be set to 0x34080000.

Generating RSA keys for ASB with openssl
----------------------------------------

The following instructions are provided as if running from the user's home
directory, which contains the U-Boot repo.

First, generate a private RSA2048 key:

	openssl genrsa -out openssl_keys/bootprivate.pem 2048

Separate the public key from the private key:

	openssl rsa -in openssl_keys/bootprivate.pem -pubout > bootpublic.pem

Signing u-boot code section with openssl
----------------------------------------

First, we need to separate the U-Boot code (including Application BL header)
from the IVT and DCD:

	dd if=u-boot/u-boot.s32 of=u-boot-tosign.s32 bs=512 skip=1042

Next, we pad the extracted U-Boot code up to 1M. To find how many bytes need to
be written at the end of u-boot-tosign.s32, we check its size (i.e. by using
ls -l u-boot-tosign.s32), subtract it from 1M (1048576 bytes) and write the
remaining bytes to its end.

	dd if=/dev/zero bs=1 count=<remaining bytes to 1M> >> u-boot-tosign.s32

Now we can sign the padded U-Boot code:

	openssl dgst -sha1 -sign openssl_keys/bootprivate.pem -out u-boot.sign u-boot-tosign.s32

The signature can be verified with:

	openssl dgst -sha1 -verify openssl_keys/bootpublic.pem -signature u-boot.sign u-boot-tosign.s32

Next, we need to modify the RSA public modulus and public exponent in
include/hse/hse_abi.h with our generated keys. To view the public
modulus and exponent:

	openssl rsa -in bootpublic.pem -text -noout

Overwrite the modulus and exponent under include/hse/hse_abi.h with
your generated modulus and exponent.

Adding everything to the SD card
--------------------------------

We suggest using the following SD card layout:

-------------  0x0
|    IVT    |
-------------  0x100
|    MBR    |
-------------  0x200
|  HSE FW   |
-------------  0x70200
|  SYS_IMG  |
-------------  0x80200
| SIGNATURE |
-------------  0x80400
|   U-Boot  |
-------------  0x180400

The following commands will be provided for the above layout. The partitions for
Linux and the rootfs need to be moved further on the SD card, to leave sufficient
space for the data required by HSE for secure boot.

Identify your device in /dev, and copy the IVT to the SD card. We'll use 'sdb'
in this example:

	dd if=u-boot/u-boot.s32 of=/dev/sdb bs=512 count=1 conv=notrunc,fsync

Next is the HSE FW pink/blue image:

	dd if=<hse_fw_binary> of=/dev/sdb bs=512 seek=1 conv=notrunc,fsync

The signature;

	dd if=u-boot.sign of=/dev/sdb bs=512 seek=1025 conv=notrunc,fsync

We need the DCD from the original u-boot.s32, so:

	dd if=u-boot/u-boot.s32 of=/dev/sdb bs=512 skip=1026 seek=1026 count=16 conv=notrunc,fsync

Finally, we can copy the modified U-Boot that we've signed:

	dd if=u-boot-tosign.s32 of=/dev/sdb bs=512 seek=1042 conv=notrunc,fsync

Booting in secure boot
----------------------

To activate secure boot, we first need to generate a SYS-IMG file for HSE, which
will be signed with a device-specific key. Fortunately, this is handled by HSE
itself, and is taken care of by the ASB demo application. Boot the board, and
run the following in the U-Boot command line:

	hse_adv_secboot_prep_demo

After the command has run, you can reboot the board and it will boot securely. You
can check by verifying the secure boot bit in the IVT:

00000020: 0024 0800 0000 0000 0900 0000 0000 0000

Turning off secure boot
-----------------------

To stop booting securely, the IVT must be rewritten and the SYS-IMG on the SD card
must be deleted. The secure boot SD layout need not be kept, so this can easily be
done by overwriting the data on the SD card, though it is suggested to zero out the
area needed before hand.

	dd if=u-boot/u-boot.s32 of=/dev/sdb bs=512 conv=notrunc,fsync
