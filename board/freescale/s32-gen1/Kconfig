	  The configuration for the PCIe controllers, stored in
	  the variable 'hwconfig'
	  It configures the mode (rc, ep, sgmii) or the clock type
	  (internal or external)
	  It is also possible to configure combo mode either ep&sgmii or
	  rc&sgmii, with these configurations lane0 is PCIe and lane1
	  is connected to mac depending on 'xpcs_mode'.
	  SGMII uses additional configurations 'fmhz' and 'xpcs_mode'.
	  Config 'xpcs_mode' is used to specifically configure each line in
	  SGMII mode. The following are valid options: '2G5', 'both', '0' and
	  '1'. Mode '2G5' uses lane0 in 2.5G mode and leaves lane1 disabled.
	  Mode 'both' configures both lanes for 1G operation so 2 macs can
	  be connected. Mode '0' is used to configure only XPCS0, this can be
	  used in 'sgmii' mode (one lane emac 1G other lane disabled) or
	  in 'rc&sgmii'/'ep&sgmii' (one lane PCIeX1 other lane SGMII 1G).
	  Same configuration is used for '1', which corresponds to XPCS1.
	  Config 'fmhz' specifies frequency used as reference. In case of
	  2.5G mode it is required to set this 125, if used in SGMII/PCIe
	  combo mode 'fmhz' has to be 100 (PCIe ignores this and always
	  uses 100). In case the SerDes is configured as SGMII and not in
	  2.5G mode either 100 or 125 can be used in 'fmhz'.
	  Available 'xpcs_mode' are depedent on platform:
	  	s32g274a - supports '0','1','both' and '2G5'
	  	s32r45   - supports '0' and '2G5'
